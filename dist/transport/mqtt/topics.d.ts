/**
 * Anker secure-MQTT topic vocabulary + the per-line credential scope.
 *
 * Two facts about this broker drive everything here, both CONFIRMED live (2026-07-28) against a real
 * `eufy_life` light and cross-read from the disassembled V6 app
 * (`com.anker.esiotkit.security_device.mqtt.SecurityMqttConstant`, `mqtt_serve.dart`):
 *
 *  - **The device→app leg is not `/res` for every line.** `eufy_life` reports land on `/app/res`;
 *    the app subscribes four topics per light device and `/res` carries nothing. Other lines use
 *    `/res` alone.
 *  - **The topic space is partitioned by credential.** `get_user_mqtt_info` returns a DIFFERENT
 *    certificate per `app-name`, and the AWS IoT policy granting `eufy_life/...` is attached only to
 *    the `eufy_life` cert. Subscribing to a light's topics with the default credential is *silently*
 *    denied — the broker answers SUBACK with a 128 grant rather than rejecting, which is why this
 *    produced total silence instead of an error.
 *
 * Scope is derived from `EufyDevice.category` — a device-record field, not a capability — so this
 * stays on the transport side of the capability↔transport boundary.
