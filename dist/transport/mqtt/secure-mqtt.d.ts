/**
 * Secure MQTT ("smqtt") — Anker AIoT broker, mutual-TLS.

 * Broker: mqtts://aiot-mqtt-{region}.anker.com:8883. Credentials come from the
 * mega API `get_user_mqtt_info` call: a per-user client certificate + RSA key,
 * and a server CA (the `aws_root_ca1_pem` field, despite the name, is a GoDaddy
 * root). The default clientId is the cert CN = `{user_id}-{app_name}`.
 *
 * Topic vocabulary and the per-line credential scope live in `./topics.ts` — publish to `/req`
 * (cloud→device commands), subscribe to whichever inbound legs that line uses. Granted for eufy_mega +
 * eufy_home devices; eufy_security (cameras) are DENIED here (they use P2P) — see src/types.ts
 * classifyDevice.
