/**
 * TLS shape for dialling an AIoT broker instance by bare IP.
 *
 * The broker hostname fronts several independent backend instances that do not share subscribe/publish
 * routing, so both the pinned transport and the reachability probe in `./broker-discovery.ts` connect
 * to one instance's IP directly rather than letting DNS pick. That is the only reason a bare-IP dial
 * exists here, and it is what makes this fragment necessary: Node matches the presented certificate
 * against the name passed to `connect`, which for an IP dial is the IP, and the broker's certificate
 * names the hostname. `servername` keeps SNI on that hostname so the instance answers with the same
 * certificate a DNS-resolved connect would have got, and the check is then run against it — Node's own
 * matcher, given the name the server answered for. Nothing is relaxed or reimplemented.
 *
 * Both call sites need the identical recipe, so it lives in one place.
