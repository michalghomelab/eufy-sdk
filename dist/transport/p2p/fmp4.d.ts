     * sample-size-present (`0x000200`) | sample-flags-present (`0x000400`). A parser sizes the sample
     * table from these flags alone, so every extra flag adds a 4-byte field per sample that it then reads
     * past the end of the box. A flag set wider than the body makes the run overrun its own size and the
     * whole fragment undemuxable, which is why the value and the loop below must be read together.
     *
     * Composition-time offsets are deliberately absent: the source delivers access units in decode order
     * with no reordering, so each sample's composition time equals its decode time.
     *
     * `data_offset` is written as zero and patched with the sample data's position once the enclosing
     * `moof` is assembled and its length is known.
