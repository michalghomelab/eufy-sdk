 * Each frame declares only the payload IT carries ({@link VideoFrameHeader.payloadLength}), so the unit's
 * total length is nowhere on the wire and cannot be waited for. What the wire does carry, verified on two
 * models:
 *
 *  - the frames of one unit **repeat its header** — same timestamp, same {@link VideoFrameHeader.sequence} —
 *    while consecutive units differ in both;
 *  - every frame of a split unit is filled to {@link STATION_CHUNK_BYTES} except the last;
 *  - a frame that STARTS a unit begins with an Annex-B start code once decoded, and a continuation begins
 *    mid-NAL, so it does not.
 *
 * A unit is therefore held only while its latest frame is full, and completed the moment a shorter one
 * arrives — no delivery latency for the overwhelming majority of units, which arrive in one frame below
 * the threshold. The identity match and the missing start code are required TOGETHER before appending:
 * either alone would let two decodable units merge, and a merge is invisible to a consumer that trusts
 * the contract.
 *
 * **A unit is delivered only when it is complete.** A lost datagram makes the P2P layer discard the frame
 * it was reassembling, so a unit whose tail never arrives is ended by the next unit's first frame while
 * still full — that one is dropped and reported, never handed on short. Truncated bytes are worse than
 * none: a decoder given an access unit shorter than its own slice headers promise reports bitstream
 * truncation and produces no picture at all.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating. A unit that is exactly the threshold long, or an exact multiple of it,
 * ends on a full frame and is dropped as truncated — one frame in ~64000, reported, and the alternative is
 * handing a decoder bytes that may genuinely be short. And a station that fills to some OTHER size is not
 * recognised: its units stay exactly as they arrive rather than being mis-joined.
