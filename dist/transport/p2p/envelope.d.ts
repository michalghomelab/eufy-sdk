 * `model/capabilities/*.ts` as `CAMERA_CMD` / `LIGHT_CMD` / …). These two subsets are disjoint: a
 * capability never names an envelope, and the router never names a feature (it forwards `cmd.param`
 * opaquely), so `model/` and `transport/` share no command vocabulary and neither imports the other.
 *
 * The full id→name catalog ({@link CommandType}) + `commandName()` lookup live in `./commands.ts`;
 * only the handful the router drives directly are named here.
