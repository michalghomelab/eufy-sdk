 * feed a muxer can ingest.
 *
 * Two video frame variants are handled:
 *  - **Plaintext** (`signCode 0`, e.g. HomeBase-attached cameras): a fixed 22-byte frame header
 *    (`parseVideoFrameHeader`) followed directly by Annex-B NAL units — verified live (960×540,
 *    keyframe = header flag bit0). We strip the 22-byte header.
 *  - **Encrypted** (E2E cameras): the body is AES-256-GCM under a per-stream media key wrapped in a
 *    keyframe ECIES envelope. If an `eccPrivateKey` is supplied we run `VideoFrameDecoder`; otherwise
 *    those frames are skipped (no key → no video).
 *
 * Emits: `video` ({@link LiveVideoFrame} — Annex-B), `audio` ({@link LiveAudioFrame}), `start`, `stop`,

/**
 * How often the media start is re-issued to hold a stream open, when a caller expresses no preference.
 *
 * This is **on by default** because some cameras stop sending without it. With the nudge disabled, a
 * T8170 went quiet 13.6 s into a plain `live()` — no `stop`, no `error`, the feed simply stopped — and
 * ran the full window with it on (185 frames vs 704 over 40 s).
 *
 * Which cameras need it does **not** follow topology or power source, so there is no predicate to gate
 * it on: measured across four cameras, an own-session T8410 and both HomeBase-attached cameras (T8210,
 * T8114) held a 40 s stream up with the nudge disabled, while the own-session T8170 did not. All four
 * are battery. Since a camera that needs it goes silent rather than reporting anything, the default
 * covers the one that fails.
 *
 * What the nudge costs differs by topology, and only one branch is a true keepalive: an own-session
 * camera's `startLiveMedia` tracks that the stream is already started and sends the small ping, while a
 * HomeBase-attached camera has no such state and re-sends the full media start — a genuine restart on
 * that path.
 *
 * That restart is harmless on a station serving ONE camera and harmful on a station serving several: it
 * re-asserts this camera's channel every interval, so two attached streams contend continuously. Measured on
 * a real base as a full start every 3 s from each. So an attached stream stops nudging as soon as the station
 * delivers a frame of its own channel — see the private `settleKeepalive`. The measurement that justifies it
 * is the one above: the attached cameras held their window with the nudge disabled outright.
