/**
 * **Record** a clip — collect the live H.264/H.265 stream for `seconds` and mux it to a fragmented
 * MP4 (same source as {@link captureSnapshotFromShared}, kept running and written to a container).
 * Recording starts at the first complete keyframe so the clip is seekable. Requires `ffmpeg`.
 *
 * Opens its OWN {@link LiveStream} over the session rather than joining the device's shared source, so it
 * costs a second pull on a camera already streaming, and the shared path's release of a sibling's lingering
 * pull does not reach it. `recordFragments` is the shared-consumer path.
 *
 * The clip therefore starts at the SECOND keyframe, so parameter sets announced only with the first are
 * dropped along with it — every frame is watched for an announcement, including the skipped ones, and
 * the collected run is primed before muxing. This also settles the codec, which is sniffed from a config NAL:
 * a run of bare slices would otherwise fall back to H.264 and mislabel an H.265 clip.
 *
 * **Bounded in both phases, so it always settles.** The first phase is bounded by `timeoutMs` waiting for the
 * keyframe the clip starts at; the second is bounded by the clip's own window, which is armed as a deadline
 * the moment capture starts rather than being read off the next frame to arrive. A camera that goes quiet
 * mid-clip delivers no further frame to compare a clock against — measured on an own-session camera that
 * stopped 13.6 s into a stream with no `stop` and no `error` — so a clip whose end is decided inside a frame
 * handler has no end at all, and the promise stays pending for the life of the process. The deadline answers
 * with the run collected up to it: the window the caller asked for has elapsed, and frames the camera never
 * sent cannot be waited into existence.
 *
 * A pull whose SESSION goes away before that window elapses fails the clip instead, naming the close. No
 * further frame can arrive on it, so there is nothing left to wait for, and a caller that asked for a clip of
 * a stated length is told the session went away rather than handed a fragment as if it were the clip. A decode
 * failure on the stream fails it the same way.
 *
 * The `error` listener outlives the collection deliberately. An unhandled `error` on an emitter takes the host
 * process down, and the stream is stopped only after the promise settles, so it stays attached and a late
 * failure lands on an already-settled promise as the no-op it is.

/**
 * The geometry a JPEG declares in its own frame header (`SOFn`), or `undefined` when it carries none.
 *
 * Walks the marker segments from the SOI rather than searching for the marker bytes: a `0xffc0` pair
 * occurs inside quantization tables and entropy-coded data, and the first one found there would answer
 * with two bytes of image content. Every `SOFn` puts precision, then height, then width at the same
 * offset past its length field, so one read serves all of them. Any number of `0xff` fill bytes may
 * precede a marker, and the standalone markers carry no length to skip by — both are what a naive walk
 * gets wrong, and either would make a perfectly good image read as having no geometry.
 *
 * Decoding the image (the `jpeg-js` path the v2 thumbnail decoder needs) would answer the same question,
 * but it is synchronous pure JS over every pixel: this needs a dozen bytes of header, so it reads them.
