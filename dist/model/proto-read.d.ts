/**
 * The field readers every Raw-DP decoder on this line shares.
 *
 * `RawDpCodec` hands back a flat list of `{ field, kind, value }` and stops there — it has no schema
 * and no idea which message it just walked. Turning that list into a reading is the decoder's job, and
 * these are the readers every decoder on this line shares: the interesting part is not the code but the
 * RULE each one encodes, and a rule spelled out in three places drifts in two of them.
 *
 * **The rule, in one line: proto3 omits a zero, so absent and zero are the same bytes.** A field set to
 * `0`, `false` or `""` is not written to the wire at all, which means no reader here can tell "the
 * device said zero" from "the device said nothing". Every function below therefore answers with the
 * zero member rather than with `undefined`, and a decoder that needs the distinction has to find it
 * somewhere else in the message — a `oneof` branch, a sibling flag, a wrapper message whose presence
 * is itself the signal. Reading a defaulted zero as a real value is where this project's silent wire
 * bugs have come from, three times over.
 *
 * @module model/proto-read

 * `sint32` maps small negatives onto small unsigned values so they cost one byte instead of ten, and
