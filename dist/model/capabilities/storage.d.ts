 * `storage` — on-device storage (SD card / eMMC / HDD).
 *
 * A station-codec baseline capability, since hubs own recordings. It contributes no state properties:
 * no owned station reports a capacity or SD-card parameter, and the one id a table here could point at
 * (1131) is `deviceStatus` in the param dictionary — reported by ten devices with an unrelated meaning,
 * so a capacity getter over it would install widely and answer a device-status code as megabytes.
 * Capacity earns a member when a station is captured reporting one.
