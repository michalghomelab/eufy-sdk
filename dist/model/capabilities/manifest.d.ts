/**
 * What a device exposes, as data — one JSON-safe shape per device, with no branch per capability.
 *
 * A bound device is fully callable but states nothing about ITSELF from outside the package: neither
 * what is installed nor what a value means is readable off it. The member table states both, and this
 * turns that statement into a public, JSON-safe shape: which reads a device actually installed, which
 * of its actions are offerable, and which events it emits.
 *
 * **Derived from the LIVE bound objects, not recomputed from the tables.** The descriptors of the bound
 * object are the only source that cannot disagree with what `bindMembers` installed — evidence
 * gates, provider gates and unverified writes are all already applied there. Recomputing the same answer
 * from the module tables would be a second implementation of the gate, and it would be wrong in exactly
 * the cases that matter: a media method on a device bound without that provider, a read for a param
 * the device never reported. The table is joined in only for SEMANTICS (what the value means), which the
 * bound object does not carry.
 *
 * **Never spread, `Object.entries` or `JSON.stringify` a bound object here.** All three invoke its
 * getters, and a getter with a `decode` calls into the injected codec. Property descriptors only.
 *
 * @module model/capabilities/manifest
