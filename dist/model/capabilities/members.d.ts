     * answering `undefined` forever. That is exactly the failure the evidence gate exists to prevent.
     *
     * *Second source* (with a `param`): the member keeps its own wire and its own spec, and reaches into
     * the owner's payload only on a device that did not report that wire. This is what lets ONE property
     * span both clean lines when the two report it differently — the legacy Tuya line puts the lifetime
     * cleaned area on its own DP, the AIoT line buries it inside `CleanStatistics` on DP 167. Without it,
     * the same value would need two names and every host would branch on device family to ask for it.
     * The `decode` sees whichever raw value the device actually has, so it discriminates on SHAPE, the way
     * the clean line's cross-family decoders already do.
     *
     * **Watch what the owner was installed BY.** An owner with {@link readAliases} can be present because
     * of an alias, and the value stored under its property is then the ALIAS's — a different wire carrying
     * a different figure. A borrowing member that cannot come from that wire has to screen for it, either
     * with its own {@link available} gate or in its `decode`; `lifetimeCleanCount` does both.
     *
     * Read-only either way. Setting a field inside a shared payload means re-encoding the whole message,
     * which needs an encoder and a captured write this SDK does not have; the owner keeps that wire.
     * Guarded by `property-id-integrity.spec.ts`.
     *
     * **Naming an owner in ANOTHER capability.** A string names a sibling in this table, which covers
     * every payload whose readings all belong to one capability. Some do not: `DeviceInfo` on DP 169
     * carries the robot's MAC, SSID and IP beside the DOCK's firmware version, and the one-owner rule is
     * per product LINE — so one capability must own that id and the other's reading would otherwise have
     * to hang off the wrong object. The `{ property, param }` form says "read the property another module
     * owns, gated on the param that carries it", which works because `Device` keys state by NAME in one
     * flat namespace shared across capabilities. Both halves are stated rather than looked up: a member
     * declaring this cannot see the other module's table, and the guard checks the pair against the

 *    ABSENT rather than a key holding `undefined` — `"talkback" in cam` has to mean the camera can talk.
 *    Any falsy answer counts, so a builder can guard with `&&` instead of spelling out a ternary.
 *  - **A derived setter never throws synchronously.** A builder may throw (arming's needs the account
 *    identity and says so by throwing) and a method returning `Promise<void>` must not surprise a caller
 *    chaining `.catch()`. Caught here once rather than in each module's own wrapper.
