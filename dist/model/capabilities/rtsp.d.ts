 *
 * - **A station publishes for ONE attached camera at a time.** Enabling a second withdraws the first,
 *   silently — the station tracks a single camera, not a set. The SDK cannot detect or prevent this;
 *   a caller driving several cameras owns the arbitration.
 * - **Publication is a persistent device setting, not an SDK-owned media session.** An RTSP consumer
 *   connects directly to the serving device; the SDK does not observe consumer disconnects and does
 *   not withdraw in response. The caller that publishes owns calling `withdraw()` when its recorder is
 *   done. The SDK deliberately applies no live-media power budget: on a device with the `battery`
 *   capability, leaving RTSP published will drain the cell, so the feature suits mains-powered cameras
 *   feeding a recorder.
 *
 * The stream itself is served over plain RTSP on the local network, by the station for a
 * HomeBase-attached camera or by the camera itself when standalone. A standalone camera has been
 * observed serving a Digest challenge. A tested HomeBase-attached camera echoed freshly supplied Basic
 * credentials in its URL but stayed open without them. Verify storage from the device-reported URL
 * and the served effect on each endpoint with an RTSP `DESCRIBE`: 401 = challenged, 200 = open.
