/**
 * Capability param access — the shared surface capability modules use to WRITE a param (the
 * command-intent builders) and to READ one (the typed read extractors at the bottom of this file).
 *
 * **Write:** a capability states *what* to change (param id + already-polarity-resolved value) and,
 * when the firmware pins it, *which wire form* the data takes. It never picks an encryption level or
 * assembles a P2P frame: the transport resolver ({@link module:index} `resolveScalar`) does that,
 * session-first for `"auto"`. Adding or changing a capability = call these helpers; the transport
 * stays untouched.
 *
 * **Read:** the `readNum`/`readBool`/`readStr` extractors narrow a live property to a typed value for
 * the fluent read getters (`dev.battery()?.level`) — the dual of the write builders.
 *
 * @module model/capabilities/access
 * ## `ScalarForm`
 * - `"auto"` — a scalar int whose encryption level the **session** decides: L2 direct-binary when a
 *   level-2 key is negotiated, else L1 int-string. Correct for params that are the same bytes either
 *   way (camera power 1035 — verified live on standalone T8410 = L1 and HomeBase T8114 = L2).
 * - `"int-string"` — force the L1 int+string frame. For params the firmware only accepts as level-1
 *   even on a HomeBase (status LED 1045; the Cam2C/2/3 floodlight switch 1400).
 * - `"direct-binary"` — force the L2 binary "direct" frame (spotlight brightness/color-temp/enable).
 *
 * ({@link ScalarForm} is declared in `./types` to keep the Command union self-contained.)
