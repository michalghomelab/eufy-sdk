/**
 * Per-SKU DP capability catalog — the parsed result of a `get_product_data_point` API call.
 *
 * The response carries one entry per data point, each declaring `dp_id`, a stable `code`, a
 * human `name`, an access `mode`, a `data_type` and a `property` blob. Only the enum ranges are
 * read here; the names and writability that same call reports are already resolved offline into
 * `CLEAN_PARAMS`, so what this adds is the per-SKU narrowing a shared dictionary cannot carry —
 * two products with the same DP can offer different value sets.
 *
 * Still defensive at every step: a missing key or a mismatched shape yields an empty catalog and
 * capabilities fall back to their safe defaults, because a wrong range is worse than none.
