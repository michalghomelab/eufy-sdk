/**
 * The cleaning scenes a robot holds — `SceneResponse` on DP 180, decoded.
 *
 * A scene is a saved routine: which rooms or zones, in what order, with which clean parameters. The
 * robot reports the LIST over this DP — ids, names, the map each belongs to, whether each still works
 * — while the tasks inside a scene are only ever sent, never reported. So this reads what the device
 * publishes and does not pretend to the rest.
 *
 * **A real `mapId` is on this DP.** Multi-map management on DP 172 cannot supply one:
 * `multi_maps.proto` states outright that a `MAP_GET_ALL` or `MAP_GET_ONE` response travels over p2p
 * rather than the data point, leaving DP 172 carrying only the method, sequence and result of an
 * operation. `SceneInfo.mapid` is on the DP, and so is a scheduled rooms-clean's `map_id` — two reads
 * that carry the id the area-select frames need, with no p2p transfer and no default invented for them.
